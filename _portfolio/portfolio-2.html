As Moore’s Law continues to plateau, the industry has increasingly turned to specialized hardware design solutions to sustain performance scaling, particularly for artificial intelligence and high-performance computing applications. Representative examples of this paradigm shift include Google’s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs); Amazon AWS’s Graviton, Trainium, and Inferentia processors; Apple’s A- and M-series system-on-chips (SoCs); Meta’s Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA); Microsoft’s Maia and Cobalt chips; Tesla’s Dojo accelerators; Broadcom’s custom AI application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs); and large-scale FPGA-based systems. Building on this trend, this project introduces a transformative quantum–classical co-design framework that tightly integrates circuit-cutting techniques with specialized multi-FPGA architectures to enable scalable and accelerated simulation.
